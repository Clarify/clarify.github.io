<a name="{{ tabs }}"></a>

<h3>Loading Audio</h3>

<p>First include the SDK and create your object using your API Key. Once you&#8217;ve created the object, you can use the object to load each of your audio files as shown:</p>

{% include /structural/tabs.html %}

<p>Naming the bundle and providing a <code>notify_url</code> are both optional. We have a number of audio and video files available for processing on <a href="http://clarify.io/media">our Media Page</a>.</p>

{% include /messages/no-download.html %}

After creating a bundle, you'll receive a response which looks something like this:

{% include /source/json/bundle_callback.md %}
