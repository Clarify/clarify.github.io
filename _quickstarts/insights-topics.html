<p>This quickstart demonstrates how to load an audio or video file and request your topics in a few minutes.</p>

{% include /sections/setup.html %}

{% include /sections/media-loading.html %}

<p>After creating a bundle, you'll receive a response which looks something like this:</p>

{% include /source/json/bundle_callback.md %}

<h3>Getting your Topics</h3>

<p>The most important part of the bundle notification is the &#8216;href' of the &#8216;clarify:insights' key. By retrieving the contents of that URI, Clarify will give you a list of the Insights available.</p>

{% include /sections/insight-links.html %}

<p>This will return with the list of available insights:</p>

{% include /source/json/insights_r4.md %}

<p>The most important part of this payload is the <strong>href</strong> of the <strong>insight:spoken_topics</strong> key. By retrieving the contents of that URI, Clarify will give you the topics recognized from the audio.</p>

{% include /sections/request-topics.html %}

<p>The final result of which is our list of topics:</p>

{% include /source/json/insights_topics.md %}

<p>From here, we can process the topics just like any other json array:</p>

{% include /sections/process-topics.html %}

<p>And we end up with a list of topics that we can use to categorize or otherwise sort our content for better understanding:</p>

{% include /source/json/processed_topics.md %}
