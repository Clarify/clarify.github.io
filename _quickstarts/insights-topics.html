This quickstart demonstrates how to load an audio or video file and request your topics in a few minutes.

{% include /sections/setup.html %}

{% include /sections/media-loading.html %}

After creating a bundle, you'll receive a response which looks something like this:

{% include /source/json/bundle_callback.md %}

<h3>Getting your Topics</h3>

The most important part of the bundle notification is the &#8216;href' of the &#8216;clarify:insights' key. By retrieving the contents of that URI, Clarify will give you a list of the Insights available.

{% include /sections/insight-links.html %}

This will return with the list of available insights:

{% include /source/json/insights_r4.md %}

The most important part of this payload is the <strong>href</strong> of the <strong>insight:spoken_topics</strong> key. By retrieving the contents of that URI, Clarify will give you the topics recognized from the audio.

{% include /sections/request-topics.html %}

The final result of which is our list of topics:

{% include /source/json/insights_topics.md %}

From here, we can process the topics just like any other json array:

{% include /sections/process-topics.html %}

And we end up with a list of topics that we can use to categorize or otherwise sort our content for better understanding:

{% include /source/json/processed_topics.md %}
