This quickstart demonstrates how to load an audio file and request a transcript in just a matter of minutes.

{% include /sections/setup.html %}

{% include /sections/loading-audio.html %}

{% assign tabs="request-insights" %}

<a name="{{ tabs }}"></a>

<h2>Getting your Transcript</h2>

The most important part of the bundle notification is the <code>href</code> of the <code>clarify:insights</code> key. By retrieving the contents of that URI, Clarify will give you a list of the Insights available.

{% include /structural/tabs.html %}

This will return with the list of available insights:

{% include /source/json/insights_r4.md %}

{% assign tabs="request-transcript" %}

<a name="{{ tabs }}"></a>

The most important part of this payload is the <code>href</code> of the <code>insight:transcript_r4</code> key. By retrieving the contents of that URI, Clarify will give you a complete list of the words recognized from the audio.

{% include /structural/tabs.html %}

The result of which will be a JSON representation of the transcript as shown below. Based on the number and duration of the audio, there will be anywhere from zero to many <code>segments</code>, each describing one portion of the dialog.

{% include /source/json/transcript_r4.md %}
