    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Can I use a YouTube url to create a bundle?</strong></p>
    <p>No. In order to process your audio or video, our systems have to download it. Converting a YouTube url into a media url is challenging because they occasionally change how it's generated. We recommend you to use your raw media url directly.</p>
    <p><strong>What languages do you support?</strong></p>
    <p>At the time of this writing, English, Spanish, and French. We're always working to add more languages so if your language isn't listed, <a href="mailto:support@clarify.io">contact us</a> as we might have your language in a private beta.</p>
    <p><strong>Where are you based?</strong></p>
    <p>Just east of downtown Austin, TX. If you're in town, you should drop by our offices. <a href="http://clarify.io/contact-us">Just drop us a note</a> to let us know when you want to visit.</p>
