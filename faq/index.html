                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <hr />
                <p><strong>Can I use a YouTube url to create a bundle?</strong></p>
                <p>No. In order to process your audio or video, our systems have to download it. Converting a YouTube url into a media url is challenging because they occasionally change how it&#8217;s generated. We recommend you to use your raw media url directly.</p>
                <p><strong>What languages do you support?</strong></p>
                <p>At the time of this writing, English, Spanish, and French. We&#8217;re always working to add more languages so if your language isn&#8217;t listed, <a href="mailto:support@clarify.io">contact us</a> as we might have your language in a private beta.</p>
