**Can I use a YouTube url to create a bundle?**

No. In order to process your audio or video, our systems have to download it. Converting a YouTube url into a media url is challenging because they occasionally change how it's generated. We recommend you to use your raw media url directly.

**What languages do you support?**

English, Spanish, and French though we're working to add more languages. If your language isn't listed, <a href="mailto:support@clarify.io">contact us</a> as we might have your language in a private beta.

**Where are you based?**

We're based in Austin, TX. If you're in town, you should <a href="http://clarify.io/contact-us">drop by our offices</a>. We host a happy hour most Thursdays 5-7pm, just <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clarifyinc/events">RSVP on Facebook</a>.
